## Project 1 - A Random Quote Generator

An app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked or automatically get's updated every 2 seconds with a different background color.

Originally the randomColor() function used an array of WCAG AAA colors, that was randomized similar to the getRandomQuote() function, but for the sake of practice I'm using the refactored version

The Code was tested on:
 - Chrome v 100.0.4896.88
 - Safari v 15.3
